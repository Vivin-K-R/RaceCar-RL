# RaceCar_RL
A Reinforcement Learning based Autonomous Car Racing Agent trained on the CarRacing-v3 environment using Proximal Policy Optimization (Cnn Policy) with Stable-Baselines3. The system uses parallelized training using SubprocVecEnv, reward-threshold callbacks, and TensorBoard logging to achieve stable, high-performance driving behavior.
